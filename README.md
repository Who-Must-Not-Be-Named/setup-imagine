# setup-imagine
This setup will allow the battery capturing.
The battery should be maintained in any system. Since, any laptop/palmtop battery should be charged upto 80%, so that it has a longer life, and must be plugged on at atleast 40%. This setup is for creating a script which will allow the user to switch off the power plugged when the battery reaches at 80%.
